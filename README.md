# node-code-challenge-11162018

### Code Challenge Instructions:
Write a Node script (v8 preferred) that transforms data.json into data-transformed.json. There is no need for any UI, it’s fine to directly read in data.json from the current directory. 

Restrictions: 
•	No for or for…of loops 
•	No let or var

### Testing

* Download or clone code from https://github.com/amusto/node-code-challenge-11162018 and 
* Open a terminal window in your cloned directory and type the command "node index.js"
* The generated file will be created at ./data/data-transformed.json
 
 ### Comments
 * I kept it simple and hope I followed the instructions well. It took me about 2 hours to write and clean up.
 * I also left some of my work commented out for review. I tend to write code out in ES5 syntax, cleaning up after.
